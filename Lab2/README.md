# 2 Lab
## Calculating the variant
```
1204 % 4 = 0
```
**Therefore my variant:**
| Rest | First realization | Second realization |
|----------|----------|----------|
| 0 | Circular single linked list  | List based on array  |

## Circular linked list - [realization](https://github.com/Stefan-Bilokrynytskyi/Metodologies-labs/blob/71709fadd3b8e9944ee8ed3a0e0c188efc1ce5a3/Lab2/src/circularList.js)

## List based on array - [realization](https://github.com/Stefan-Bilokrynytskyi/Metodologies-labs/blob/main/Lab2/src/ListBasedOnArray.js)

## The usage
> Before the usage you need to install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. Clone the repository : ``` git clone https://github.com/Stefan-Bilokrynytskyi/Metodologies-labs.git```
2. Install dependencies : ```npm i```
3. Run tests: ```npm run test```

## Conclusion
**Javascript is a programming language in which it is quite difficult to catch errors or bugs. However, I can say surely that writing tests has greatly simplified not only writing code, but also ensured my confidence that my code works in all possible situations correctly. I liked this lab so much that even the position of a tester looks attractive to me.**
